      <h1>What is climate change ?</h1>
      <p>
        Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather
        patterns. These shifts may be natural, such as through variations in the
        solar cycle. But since the 1800s, human activities have been the main
        driver of climate change, primarily due to burning fossil fuels like
        coal, oil and gas.

      <h3>Global Temperature Is Rising</h3>
      <p class="white">
        The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees
        Fahrenheit (1 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change
        driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere
        and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40
        years, with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years
        2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5
      </p>
      <h3>Sea Level Is Rising</h3>
      <p class="white">
        Global sea level rose about 8 inches (20 centimeters) in the last
        century. The rate in the last two decades, however, is nearly double
        that of the last century and accelerating slightly every year.10 Image

      <h3>Ocean Acidification Is Increasing</h3>
      <p class="white">
        Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface
        ocean waters has increased by about 30%.13,14 This increase is due to
        humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more
        being absorbed into the ocean. The ocean has absorbed between 20% and
        30% of total anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions in recent decades
        (7.2 to 10.8 billion metric tons per year).15,16

      <h3 class="blueHead">The Causes of Climate Change</h3>
      <p>
        Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the
        mid-20th century to the human expansion of the "greenhouse effect" â€”
        warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from Earth
        toward space. Life on Earth depends on energy coming from the Sun. About
        half the light energy reaching Earth's atmosphere passes through the air
        and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and radiated in the form
        of infrared heat. About 90% of this heat is then absorbed by greenhouse
        gases and re-radiated, slowing heat loss to space.

      <h3>Sea Level Will Rise 1-8 feet by 2100</h3>
      <p class="white">
        Global sea level has risen about 8 inches (0.2 meters) since reliable
        record-keeping began in 1880. By 2100, scientists project that it will
        rise at least another foot (0.3 meters), but possibly as high as 8 feet
        (2.4 meters), if we continue carbon emissions at our current rate. Sea
        level is rising because of added water from melting land ice and the
        expansion of seawater as it warms.
      </p>
      <h3>Hurricanes Will Become Stronger and More Intense</h3>
      <p class="white">
        The intensity of North Atlantic hurricanes, as well as the frequency of
        the strongest (Category 4 and 5) hurricanes, have all increased since
        the early 1980s. Scientists project that hurricane-associated storm
        intensity and rainfall rates will increase as the climate continues to
        warm.
      </p>
      <h3>Longer Wildfire Season</h3>
      <p class="white">
        Warming temperatures have made the wildfire season longer and more
        severe in the West, and deepening drought in the region has added to the
        risk of fires. Scientists estimate that human-caused climate change has
        already doubled the area of forest burned in recent decades. By around
        2050, the amount of land consumed by wildfires in Western states is
        projected to further increase by two to six times. Even in rainy regions
        like the Southeast, wildfires are projected to increase by about 30%.
